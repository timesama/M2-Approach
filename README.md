# The overveiw of Relaxyzer Software

Initially created as a tool to speed up the analysis of NMR data, obtained from Resonance Systems equipment, Relaxyzer has grown up in a bigger convenient tool with various functionality.


## **Key Features**
### SE: 
*The analysis of FID (Free Induction Decay, Solid Echo, MSE)*
  -Solid Content calculation
  -For advanced researchers Second Moment and T2* as well
  -Calculation of the activation energies based on T2* for the measurements at various temperatures

### DQ: 
*The analysis of Double Quantum NMR with M2 approach*
  -T2* recalculation from the DQ distribution

### DQ(Temp):
  -Comparison of T2* distributions over temperature

### T1T2:
  *Analysis of T1 and T2 curves*
  -Calculation of tau and corresponding amplitudes
  -Deconvolution onto up to 3 components

#### The tab includes analysis of 
  - regular T1\T2 curves
  - T1s recorded for different FID regions
  - T1s measured from the FFC profile obtained with Stelar equipment

### DQMQ:
*The analysis of Double Quantum NMR*
  - the construction of the build-up curve
  - nDQ calculation

### Goldman - Shen:
  - The domain size estimation
