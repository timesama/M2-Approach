# The overveiw of Relaxyzer Software

Initially created as a tool to speed up the analysis of NMR data, obtained from Resonance Systems equipment, Relaxyzer has grown up in a bigger convenient tool with various functionality.


## **Key Features**
### SE: 
*The analysis of FID (Free Induction Decay, Solid Echo, MSE)*

  -Solid Content calculation
  
  -For advanced researchers Second Moment and T2* as well

### DQ: 
*The analysis of Double Quantum NMR*

  -T2* recalculation from the DQ distribution

### DQ(Temp):

  -Comparison of T2* distributions over temperature

### T1T2:
  *Analysis of T1 and T2 curves*
  
  -Calculation of tau(1 or 2) and corresponding amplitudes
  
  -Deconvolution onto up to 3 components

#### The tab includes analysis of 
  - regular T1\T2 curves
    
  - T1s recorded for different FID regions
     
  - T1s measured from the FFC profile obtained with Stelar equipment

### 23D Model:
  -Advanced analysis of the FFC profiles
  
  -Fit to estimate taus, amplitudes, CDD constants
  
  -Deconvolution to Lorenzian curves to estimate tau's of various mobility regions
